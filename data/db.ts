It's also a field that requires a lot of creativity and problem-solving skills, which are great skills to have in any profession.

This can be a frustrating process, especially for complex codebases. However, over time I've learned some tips for debugging code more effectively, such as using good coding practices, using a debugger, and asking for help from other programmers."
